# Phases Directory

This directory contains phase definitions for the implementation plan.

Each phase:
- groups related tasks
- has a clear goal
- must be completed before moving to the next phase unless explicitly allowed

Rules:
- phases are defined during Stage 5
- phases are frozen after planning freeze
- phase order matters
